# Start using BCMS with your favorite framework in 10 minutes

In this quick guide, you'll see how to set up a brand-new website to work with BCMS. The aim is to help you set up the codebase & CMS in under 10 minutes. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  To start and run the BCMS locally, you will need a few tools:
  - [Node 14+](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/){{ target: '_blank' }}
  - [NPM 6+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/){{ target: '_blank' }}
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/){{ target: '_blank' }}
  - [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){{ target: '_blank' }}

  Make sure to have them installed before you continue. Click on each of the items above to read the installation instructions.
</Note>

The easiest way to start BCMS project locally is by using the [BCMS CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@becomes/cms-cli).

## Install BCMS CLI

To install it globally, run this command in your terminal:
<CodeGroup>
  ```bash
  npm install @becomes/cms-cli -g
```
</CodeGroup>

To verify that the installation went well, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash
  bcms --help
```
</CodeGroup>

## Create BCMS project

Now that you have the CLI installed, all you have to do is open a terminal, navigate to a location where you want to create the project, and run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash
  bcms --cms create
```
</CodeGroup>

This command will prompt you to enter the name of your project.

<Note>
  Since BCMS relies on Docker to run all application segments, please ensure that Docket is running on your system. Run ```docker ps -a``` to list all available docker containers. The command will succeed only if the Docker engine is running. Don't worry if your docker table is empty. That's fine üëç
</Note>

## Start a development server

After creating a BCMS project, you can enter the project location from your terminal or open it in your favorite code editor or IDE, like VSCode. Inside the project, run ```docker-compose up``` or ```docker compose up```  (use whichever works for you).
<Image
  src={outputOfTheDockerComposeUpCommand}
  alt="Figure 1 - Output of the docker-compose up command."
  className="h-auto w-full"

Once all containers are started, you can open your browser and navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

<Image
  src={bcmsInLocalDev}
  alt="Figure 2 - The BCMS in local development."
  className="h-auto w-full"

That's all! You can now explore BCMS locally on your machine. üòç

**Is this a full version of the BCMS?**

**Yes, it is.** There are no feature restrictions, and you can do everything that you can do with a production-deployed version. The only difference is that the instance is not connected to the BCMS Cloud, so you cannot create users.

## What's next

Great, you're now set up with a BCMS instance! It's time to connect it with your favorite framework:
