# BCMS SDK & Caching

Caching is a vital feature of the BCMS SDK.  It helps to minimize the number of requests made to the Backend server, reduce internet usage, and improve UI performance.

When data is requested, the SDK first checks to see if it is already stored in the cache. If it is, the cached data is returned immediately without sending a request to the Backend. It means that subsequent requests for the same data are much faster and have a smaller network payload.
