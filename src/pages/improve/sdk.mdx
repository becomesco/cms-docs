# Welcome to the BCMS SDK documentation page

BCMS SDK is a module that abstracts API communication. It takes care of making REST API calls, managing data caching, storage etc.
The BCMS SDK provides a lot of helpful features, including:

- Authentication management so you don't have to worry about security tokens and their lifecycles.
- An intuitive interface for communicating with the Backend API. Instead of making HTTP requests, developers can use abstract methods like sdk.template.getAll() to retrieve data.
- Socket support for data synchronization, ensuring that the cache is always in sync with other sessions.
- Integration with Vue store, allowing the use of powerful computed methods.
- A cache layer that stores data in memory for a session. When the browser tab reloads, the cache is lost. Read more about [BCMS SDK Caching.](/improve/caching)

Access the BCMS SDK via ```window.bcms.sdk.*``` in your UI code to get started.

To illustrate how caching works in the BCMS SDK, consider the following example:

A client logs in and requests all available widgets using ```sdk.widget.getAll()```. Since this is the first time this method has been called, a request is made to the Backend, and the data is received and stored in the cache. A copy of the data is also returned to the client.

A bit later, the client requests all widgets again using ```sdk.widget.getAll()```. This time, the SDK checks the cache and finds that the data is already present. It returns a copy of the data from the cache without sending a request to the Backend.

Updating cached data is also easy. When clients want to make changes to a widget, they can call ```sdk.widget.update(myUpdatedWidget)```, and the SDK will send a request to the Backend to update the widget. The Backend will then respond with the updated widget, which the SDK will use to update the corresponding widget in the cache. The widget will be added to the cache if it doesn't exist there already.

Caching becomes increasingly more important when there are more clients connected to the same Backend simultaneously. For example, consider two clients, **C1** and **C2**, who requested and received a copy of all widgets. If C1 updates a widget, C2's cache must also be updated to remain in sync with the Backend. The BCMS SDK uses sockets to solve this problem. With every update on the Backend, all active clients get informed via socket. That's how C2 retrieves the updated widget and updates its cache accordingly.


The BCMS SDK makes it easy for developers to work with cached data without worrying about the underlying implementation details. It helps to improve the performance and usability of the BCMS UI, and allows developers to focus on creating a great user experience.
