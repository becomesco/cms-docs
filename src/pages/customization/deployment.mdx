# Deployment

Deploying your locally developed [Functions](/customization/functions),
[Events](/customization/events) and [Jobs](/customization/jobs) is very 
simple using [BCMS CLI](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-cli).

Inside of the project, first, run `npm run bundle`. This command will compile
TypeScript files and bootstrap the project. After that, only thing left to do 
is to deploy your code by running `npm run deploy`.
