# BCMS Events

BCMS Events are JavaScript functions that get triggered by events inside BCMS.
They allow you to run some custom code when a specific event happens.

## Creating an event handler

To create an event handler, create a file inside `src/events`, for example, `test.ts`.
To keep is simple, this event will only log data which it receives:

<CodeGroup title="src/events/test.ts">
```ts
import { createBcmsEvent } from '@becomes/cms-backend/src/event';
import {
  BCMSEventConfigMethod,
  BCMSEventConfigScope,
} from '@becomes/cms-backend/src/types';

export default createBcmsEvent(async () => {
  return {
    config: {
      scope: BCMSEventConfigScope.ENTRY,
      method: BCMSEventConfigMethod.ADD,
    },
    async handler(data) {
      console.log(data);
    },
  };
});
```
</CodeGroup>

The event handler you created will trigger every time a new
[Entry](/inside-bcms/entries) is added to the database.

## Triggering an event

Only Functions, Jobs, and Plugins can trigger internal events. Events are triggered using the [Event Manager](https://github.com/bcms/backend/blob/master/src/event/main.ts#L12).
A few examples:

```ts
// Trigger Entry Added event
await BCMSEventManager.emit(
  BCMSEventConfigScope.ENTRY,
  BCMSEventConfigMethod.ADD,
  {
    // Entry data
  }
);

// Trigger Template Updated event
await BCMSEventManager.emit(
  BCMSEventConfigScope.TEMPLATE,
  BCMSEventConfigMethod.UPDATE,
  {
    // Template data
  }
);

// Trigger custom event
await BCMSEventManager.emit(
  'MY_CUSTOM_SCOPE',
  'MY_CUSTOM_METHOD',
  {
    custom: 'data',
  }
);
```

## Deploying an event

When you are ready to deploy your event to the CMS, follow these steps:

- Inside the project, run `npm run bundle`. This will compile TypeScript files and bootstrap the project.
- Then, to deploy your event, run `npm run deploy`.
