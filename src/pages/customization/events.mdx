# BCMS Events

BCMS Events are JavaScript functions which are executed by internal backend
Events. They allow you to run some custom code when specific event is
triggered.

## Creating an event handler

Creating an event handler is pretty straight forward. First you need to create
a file inside of the `src/events`, for example, let's create a file called
`test.ts`.

To keep is simple, this event will only log data which it receives:

```ts
// src/events/test.ts

import { createBcmsEvent } from '@becomes/cms-backend/src/event';
import {
  BCMSEventConfigMethod,
  BCMSEventConfigScope,
} from '@becomes/cms-backend/src/types';

export default createBcmsEvent(async () => {
  return {
    config: {
      scope: BCMSEventConfigScope.ENTRY,
      method: BCMSEventConfigMethod.ADD,
    },
    async handler(data) {
      console.log(data);
    },
  };
});
```

The event handler which we have created will be triggered every time a new
[Entry](/inside-bcms/entries) is added to the database.

## Triggering an event

Since we are talking about internal events, they can be triggered only by
internal code, this also includes Functions and Jobs. Events can be
triggered using the [Event Manager](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-backend/blob/master/src/event/main.ts#L12).
Few examples are shown bellow:

```ts
// Trigger Entry Added event
await BCMSEventManager.emit(
  BCMSEventConfigScope.ENTRY,
  BCMSEventConfigMethod.ADD,
  {
    // Entry data
  }
);

// Trigger Template Updated event
await BCMSEventManager.emit(
  BCMSEventConfigScope.TEMPLATE,
  BCMSEventConfigMethod.UPDATE,
  {
    // Template data
  }
);

// Trigger custom event
await BCMSEventManager.emit(
  'MY_CUSTOM_SCOPE', 
  'MY_CUSTOM_METHOD', 
  {
    custom: 'data',
  }
);
```
