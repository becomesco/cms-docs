# BCMS Function development

BCMS Functions are JavaScript functions that can be executed by sending an
HTTP request to the Backend API. Once function is created, it will be
available at `POST: https://{CMS_DOMAIN}/api/function/{FUNCTION_NAME}`.

## Create a function

Creating a function is pretty straight forward. First you need to create a
file inside of the `src/functions`, for example, let's create a file called
`ping-pong.ts`.

To keep it simple, this function will be public and echo pack a request body.
This can be done line this:

```ts
// src/functions/ping-pong.ts

import { createBcmsFunction } from '@becomes/cms-backend/src/function';

export default createBcmsFunction(async () => {
  return {
    config: {
      name: 'ping-pong',
      public: true,
    },
    async handler({ request }) {
      return {
        requestBody: request.body,
      };
    },
  };
});
```

After saving the file and starting the BCMS you can send a `POST` request to
`/api/function/ping-pong`. Request and response will look like this:

```txt
POST http://localhost:8080/api/function/ping-pong
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Hello world!"
}

---------------

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 2023 13:18:16 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 68
Connection: close
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
ETag: W/"44-r1QIq4dWf0ZgljC19i8Qi20S0LY"

{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "requestBody": {
      "message": "Hello world!"
    }
  }
}
```

That's it! You just created a BCMS Function. Since functions are running on the
Backend, they have access to all core utilities and helpers. This means that
functions have access to the database and, for example you can return list of
all [Entries](/inside-bcms/entries) in specific [Template](/inside-bcms/templates):

```ts
// src/functions/ping-pong.ts

import { createBcmsFunction } from '@becomes/cms-backend/src/function';
import { BCMSRepo } from '@becomes/cms-backend/src/repo';

export default createBcmsFunction(async () => {
  return {
    config: {
      name: 'ping-pong',
      public: true,
    },
    async handler() {
      const entries = await BCMSRepo.entry.methods.findAllByTemplateId(
        'TEMPLATE_ID'
      );
      return {
        entries: entries.map((entry) => {
          return {
            id: entry._id,
            title: (entry.meta[0].props[0].data as string[])[0],
          };
        }),
      };
    },
  };
});
```

## Public vs Private functions

In example above we've created a **public** function. This means that the
function can be called by anyone from anywhere without authentication. Public
functions are useful if you need to return publicly available data to many
different clients, this makes it very easy for clients to call the function 
and get the data.

In contrast to public functions, **private** function require authentication 
using [HTTP Signature](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-client/blob/master/src/util/security.ts#L6)
which is available out-of-the-box with [BCMS Client package](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-client).
