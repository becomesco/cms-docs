# BCMS Plugins

Most powerful way to extend BCMS functionality is by using BCMS Plugins. Plugins
are applications which are running inside of the CMS with UI and Backend
component.

---

## Creating a plugin

To create a plugin project, open a terminal and navigate to a place where you
would like to create it. Using the [BCMS CLI](/cli), run `bcms --plugin create`
and give a name to the project.

<Note>Make sure that you have Docker and Docket Compose installed.</Note>

Once the CLI is done, you can open the project in you favorite code editor and
run `docker-compose up`. This command will start the BCMS with the plugin mounted.
You can not open a browser and navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
In the navigation, when you expend _Plugins_ section, you will be able to see
the plugin.

Don't worry that the name of the plugin is _Bcms Plugin Name_, this is only in
development. When you bundle the plugin it will have proper name.

---

## Project structure

There a lot of directories and files in the project but `ui` and `backend` directories are the place
where you will write your code for the plugin. Inside of the `bcms-plugin.config.json`
you can change the plugin name.

- `ui` directory stores the frontend code for the plugin. This is the place
  where you will write your UI elements, call the APIs and present data to
  a user. If you need some dependencies, you can install them by moving to `ui`
  directory and running `npm i --save PACKAGE_NAME`.
- `backend` directory stores the backend code for the plugin. This is the place
  where you will write your custom REST endpoints and server-side logic. To install
  backend dependencies run `npm i --save PACKAGE_NAME` from the root of the project.

---

## Plugin Backend

Since BCMS is using [Purple Cheetah](https://github.com/becomesco/purple-cheetah)
for the backend, BCMS Plugins are also using it. This means that you will use
Purple Cheetah to create controllers and middleware.

When you create a new plugin project, it will come with example code in which
you will be able to see how to create a simple Todo plugin.

### Creating an endpoint

To create an endpoint there are 2 things that you need to do:

- Create a controller/middleware object
- Register object with BCMS Plugin handler.

To explain this in more detail, let's create an endpoint which will return
**Hello world!** response. First we will create a controller inside of the
`backend` directory, like you can see bellow:

```ts
// backend/hello-world.ts
import {
  createController,
  createControllerMethod,
} from '@becomes/purple-cheetah';

export const HelloWorldController = createController({
  name: 'Hello world',
  path: '/hello',
  methods() {
    return {
      helloWorld: createControllerMethod<void, { message: string }>({
        path: '/world',
        type: 'get',
        async handler() {
          return {
            message: 'Hello world!',
          };
        },
      }),
    };
  },
});
```

To make this controller available, only thing left to do is to add it to
BCMS Plugin handler:

```ts
// backend/main.ts

import { createBcmsPlugin } from '@becomes/cms-backend/plugin';
import { HelloWorldController } from './hello-world';
import { TodoController } from './todo';

export default createBcmsPlugin({
  name: 'bcms-plugin---name',
  controllers: [
    TodoController,
    HelloWorldController, // <-- This is our controller
  ],
});
```

We can now start the BCMS and if we send a request to this controller we will
get this:

```txt
GET http://localhost:8080/api/plugin/bcms-plugin---name/hello/world

-----------------------

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 23 Mar 2023 11:51:45 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 26
Connection: close
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
ETag: W/"1a-T7vCLEZV7pLSyUzkr9XBdG32YU8"

{
  "message": "Hello world!"
}
```

That's it! As you are able to see we can call this endpoint without any authentication
which means that it is public (anyone can access it). If you want to lock this
endpoint you can use **BCMSRouteProtection** call to create endpoint protection:

```ts
import type { BCMSRouteProtectionJwtResult } from '@becomes/cms-backend/types';
import { BCMSRouteProtection } from '@becomes/cms-backend/util';
import {
  createController,
  createControllerMethod,
} from '@becomes/purple-cheetah';
import {
  JWTPermissionName,
  JWTRoleName,
} from '@becomes/purple-cheetah-mod-jwt/types';

export const HelloWorldController = createController({
  name: 'Hello world',
  path: '/hello',
  methods() {
    return {
      helloWorld: createControllerMethod<
        BCMSRouteProtectionJwtResult,
        { message: string }
      >({
        path: '/world',
        type: 'get',
        // Endpoint protection using JWT authentication
        // --------------------------------------------
        preRequestHandler: BCMSRouteProtection.createJwtPreRequestHandler(
          [JWTRoleName.ADMIN, JWTRoleName.USER],
          JWTPermissionName.READ
        ),
        async handler() {
          return {
            message: 'Hello world!',
          };
        },
      }),
    };
  },
});
```

After this modification if we again try to send the request from above we will
get:

```txt
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 23 Mar 2023 12:03:20 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 35
Connection: close
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
ETag: W/"23-P6T7nIGEhyt+0WRId7BsUh87luo"

{
  "message": "Token is `undefined`."
}
```

## Plugin Frontend

As mentioned, frontend code for a plugin is located in `ui` directory. BCMS UI
is written in Vue 3 with TSX syntax and because of that, plugins starter comes
with everything ready to go. It is completely up to you how would you structure
the frontend code but recommend that you follow code from the starter.

It is important to note that you have access to the [SDK](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-sdk) vie
`window.bcms.sdk.*` which will allow you to easily access the Backend API.

---

## Plugin deployment

Deploying your plugin is extremely easy. Once you are ready to deploy the plugin
to the CMS, all that you have to do is run:

- `npm run bundle` - will bundle your backend and ui code and create a package,
- `npm run deploy` - will deploy the bundled plugin to the BCMS Instance which
  you've selected.

Have in mind that it may take a few moment for you to see changes on the CMS after
deploying the plugin.
