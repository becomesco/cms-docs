## Creating a job

Creating a job is pretty straight forward. First you need to create a file 
inside of the `src/jobs`, for example, let's create a file called `test.ts`.

To keep it simple, this job will only console log **Hello world!** message and
we'll do it like this:

```ts
// src/jobs/test.ts

import { createBcmsJob } from '@becomes/cms-backend/src/job';

export default createBcmsJob(async () => {
  return {
    cron: {
      dayOfMonth: '*',
      dayOfWeek: '*',
      hour: '*',
      minute: '*',
      month: '*',
    },
    async handler() {
      console.log('Hello world!');
    },
  };
});
```

The job will be executed every minute.
