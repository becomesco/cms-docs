# Extending BCMS Jobs

BCMS Jobs are JavaScript functions that execute at a specified time interval.

## Creating a BCMS job

Create a file inside `src/jobs` folder, for example, `test.ts`.

To keep it simple, this job will only console log **Hello world!** message.

<CodeGroup title="src/jobs/test.ts">
```ts
import { createBcmsJob } from '@becomes/cms-backend/src/job';

export default createBcmsJob(async () => {
  return {
    cron: {
      dayOfMonth: '*',
      dayOfWeek: '*',
      hour: '*',
      minute: '*',
      month: '*',
    },
    async handler() {
      console.log('Hello world!');
    },
  };
});
```
</CodeGroup>

The job will run every minute. The time is set using Cron time format.
[Crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) is an amazing website which allows
you to calculate time intervals.

## Deploying a job

When you are ready to deploy your job to the CMS, follow these steps:

- Inside the project, run `npm run bundle`. This will compile TypeScript files and bootstrap the project.
- Then, to deploy your job, run `npm run deploy`.
