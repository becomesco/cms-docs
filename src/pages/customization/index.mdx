# Customizing BCMS

BCMS is a complex system, and it can be overwhelming to understand every part
of it immediately. That's why we created BCMS in a way that allows developers
to easily extend its functionality without knowing every detail of the software.

Custom features can be added to the BCMS in two ways: by [creating a plugin](/customization/plugins),
which is more advanced, or by creating [functions](/customization/functions),
[events](/customization/events) and/or [jobs](/customization/jobs).
Extending BCMS functionality is limited but powerful. For example, you cannot
modify core BCMS functionality but can build on top of it.

When customizing your CMS it is good to know few abstract concepts:

- [BCMS Backend](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-backend) - or the **backend**, refers to a Core BCMS module that handles
  common and custom backend tasks. Those tasks include communication with the
  database, database caching, scoping, restrictions and security, object
  aggregation and relational updates, real-time connection with sockets,
  and many more.
- [BCMS UI](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-ui) - or the **dashboard**, refers to a Core BCMS module that provides
  a beautiful CMS user interface interface. It is simply the frontend of the BCMS.
- [BCMS SDK](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-sdk) - or the **SDK**, refers to a Core BCMS module that provides a layer
  of abstraction between the UI and the backend. It is a client side module
  used by the UI and it handles caching, communication with the backend API,
  and data synchronization, among many other things.

## Getting started

To customize your CMS you will need to create a [local CMS project](/install/locally).
Make sure to save a copy or your local project because
[deploying changes to the Cloud](/customization/deployment) will not save your
project structure, the Cloud will only store production optimized versions of
your custom code. We recommend a use of [GitHub](https://github.com),
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
for storing your code.

- [Functions](/customization/functions)
- [Events](/customization/events)
- [Jobs](/customization/jobs)
- [Deployment](/customization/deployment)
- [Plugins](/customization/plugins)
