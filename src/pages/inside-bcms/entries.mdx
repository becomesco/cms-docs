# Working with BCMS Entries

Each entry in BCMS represents a single record of the selected [Template](/inside-bcms/templates).

The structure of the Entry depends on what you have previously defined in the Template, and all properties defined in the Template will be used to build the "Meta" of this Entry.
Other than the Meta, each Entry has the area we call the "Content" area. In there, you can add text, [Widgets](/inside-bcms/widgets), and similar content.

<Image
  src={entriesMetaContent}
  alt="Entry Meta and Content areas"
  className="w-auto h-auto"

/>

The main difference between these 2 terms ( besides that Widgets are available only in the Content area ) is that everything inside of the Content is respecting the order in which the content is being added and you can reorder everything. This is great when you want to reorder your widgets sometimes in the future or when you need to add a new piece of content somewhere in the middle of the content.

{/**
 *  <Note>
 * The most common use for Entries is to use them for pages with similar ( Blog ) or unique ( Home page ) features/properties. Of course, use cases are unlimited and you are free to use it to your needs.

<Note>
  BCMS supports ~100 languages so you can add different content for different languages.

## Creating and editing an entry

To create an Entry, under "Entries" in the side navigation find the Template you want to work with and click on it. Once selected, you will find the "Add new (Template Name)" button in the top right corner.
Clicking on that button, you will be redirected to the page where you will see the same structure you have defined in the Template and you can start adding the content. Once finished with adding the meta/content, you can click "Save".

If you need to edit the entry, instead of clicking the "Add new (Template Name)" button, you can search for the entry you have created and click on the "Edit" button with the pen icon. Edit the entry and click "Update" when finished.

In case you need to add a new property field to the Meta, you can learn how to do that [here](/inside-bcms/templates#adding-properties-to-a-template).

## Duplicating an entry

## View where is the Entry used

To view where is the entry used click on the 3 vertical dots beside the "Edit" button and click on "Where is used". This will give you the list of all places where this specifc Entry has been used, such as other entries which are linking to this specific one.

---

<Note>

## Setting the entry status

Sometimes we need to temporarily withdraw an Entry from the Production, and that is where we can use Statuses to target an Entry as "Draft", "Production-Ready", "You Name It". This will of course require you to handle these statuses in your codebase, such as filtering or modyfing data based on the status, but as you can see it is a powerful way to handle multiple versions of your website.

To set the status, open the Entry and in the top right corner you can click on the status dropdown field to select/unselect a status.
