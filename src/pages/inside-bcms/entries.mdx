# Working with entries

Each entry in BCMS represents a single record of a [template](/inside-bcms/templates).

Am entry's structure depends on what properties its template has. Properties defined in its template will be used used in the *meta* section of every entry.
Other than the pre-defined meta, each entry has the area we call the *content* area. In there, you can add rich text and [widgets](/inside-bcms/widgets).

For example, if you have a Blog template, you'll probably add properties like author, category, tags and date published to the Blog's template meta. Then, in each entry's content you'll write your blog post's content, add widgets to it etc.

<Note>
  BCMS supports ~100 languages so you can add different content for different languages.

## Setting the entry status

Sometimes we want to have our entries to have different statuses. For example to specify when a blog post is ready for production. You can use statuses to mark an entry as **Draft**, **Production-Ready**, ***You Name It***. This will of course require you to handle these statuses in your codebase, such as filtering or modyfing data based on the status, but as you can see it is a powerful way to handle multiple versions of your website.

To set the status, open the entry and in the top right corner you can click on the status dropdown field to select/unselect a status.
