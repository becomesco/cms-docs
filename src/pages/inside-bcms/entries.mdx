# Working with entries

Each entry in BCMS represents a single record of a [template](/inside-bcms/templates).

An entry's structure depends on what properties its template has. Properties defined in its template will appear in the *meta* section of every entry.
Other than the pre-defined meta, each entry has the area called the *content* area. In there, you can add rich text and [widgets](/inside-bcms/widgets).

For example, if you have a Blog template, you'll probably add properties like author, category, tags and date published to the Blog's template meta. Then, in each entry's content you'll write your blog post's content, add widgets to it etc.

<Note>
  BCMS supports ~100 languages so you can add different content for different languages.

## Setting the entry status

At times, you may need to assign different statuses to your entries. This is useful to indicate when a blog post is ready for publishing. You can use different statuses like Draft, Production-Ready, and others of your choice. Handling these statuses in your codebase, like filtering or modifying data based on the status, will be necessary. However, this approach is a powerful way to manage multiple versions of your website. As you can see, it provides benefits in terms of flexibility and control.

To set the status, open the entry and in the top right corner you can click on the status dropdown field to select/unselect a status.
