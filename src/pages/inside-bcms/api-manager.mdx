# Working with API keys

API keys are used to connect your app with your CMS data. Each key gives you an option to manage permissions for [templates](/inside-bcms/templates).

To create a key, click on **Add new key**. In the next step, fill in the name, and optional description.

To edit a key, click on the key you want to edit and update the permissions, or click on the <Pen /> beside the key name to edit the name or description.

## Deleting a key

To delete a key click on **Delete**, and **Confirm** in the next step.
