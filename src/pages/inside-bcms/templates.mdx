# Working with templates

Templates in BCMS are a pre-defined content structure. Based on that structure, you can create [entries](/inside-bcms/entries).

Templates can be multi-entry or single-entry.
For example, when you create a template for your website's Home page, you'll go with a single-entry template.
When you create a template for your Blog posts, it will be a multi-entry template.

## Creating and editing a template

To create a template, click on **Add new template**. In the next step, fill in the title, for example Blog.

<Note>
  When creating templates, it's recommended to use names in singular. For example,
  use "Blog" instead of "Blogs." By using names in singular, button labels will be "Add new blog,"
  instead of "Add new blogs." However, from a functional perspective, it
  doesn't really matter what you name your templates.
