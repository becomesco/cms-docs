## Adding languages

To add a language click on the **Add** button, which will give you the list of all available languages to choose from.

When you add a new language, whenever you fetch CMS data, you will be fetching [entry](/inside-bcms/entries) data with all selected languages.
You will also see a language dropdown in every entry.

To delete a language, click on the **X** from the language card.

<Note>English is the default language in BCMS, so you won't be able to delete it. Any other language you can delete, but note that this will also remove all data you added for that language.</Note>
