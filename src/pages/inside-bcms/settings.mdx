# Settings

Settings page is used to manage data backups, your account, languages and team invites.

## Creating a backup

To create a backup of your data, click on **Backups**, and then **Create new backup**. This might take some take, depending on the size of your CMS, but all backups will be located in one place and you can download them at any time.

{/* <Note>It is recommended to make often backups of your CMS data.</Note> */}

## Edit account

To edit your account data, click on **Edit account**. This will redirect you to [cloud](/cloud), where you can edit things like name, email and avatar.

## Handling languages

To add a language click on the **Add** area, which will give you the list of all available languages to choose from.

When you add a new language, whenever you fetch CMS data, you will also be fetching [entry](/inside-bcms/entries) data with all selected languages.
