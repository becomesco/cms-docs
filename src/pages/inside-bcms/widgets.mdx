# Working with widgets

Widgets in BCMS are reusable building blocks that are used inside of [entry's content area](/inside-bcms/entries).

## Creating and editing a widget

To create a widget, click on **Add new widget**. In the next step, fill in the label, and optional description/preview image.

To edit a widget, click on the widget you want to edit and update [properties](/inside-bcms/properties), or click on the <Pen /> beside the label to edit the label or description/preview image.

## Adding properties to a widget

To add properties to your newly created widget, click **Add property** button, and select from the list of properties.

---

## View where is a widget used

To view where is a widget used, click **See where is it used**. This will give you the list of all places where this widget is currently used.

---

## Deleting a widget

Deleting a widget is as easy as clicking on the **Delete** button, entering the widgets's name and clicking **Confirm**.

<Note>
  This will remove the widget from all Entries where it is used, so delete widgets with caution.
