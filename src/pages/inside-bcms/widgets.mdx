# Working with BCMS Widgets

Widgets in BCMS are reusable building blocks that are used inside of [Entry's Content area](/inside-bcms/entries).

## Creating and editing a widget

To edit a Widget, click on the Widget you want to edit and update [Properties](/inside-bcms/properties), or click on the Pen icon beside the label to edit the label or description/preview image.

## Adding properties to a widget

To add properties to your newly created widget, click "Add property" button, and select from the list of properties.

---

## View where is the Widget used

To view where is the widget used, click "See where is it used". This will give you the list of all places where this widget has been used.

---

## Deleting a widget

Deleting a widget is as easy as clicking on the "Delete" button, entering the widgets's name and clicking "Confirm".

<Note>
  This will remove the widget from all Entries where it was used, so use it at
  your own risk.
