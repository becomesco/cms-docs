# Working with media

Media manager allows you to store your images, videos and other files with many ways to organize them [using folders](/inside-bcms/media#using-folders).

---

## Uploading media

To upload a media file, click on **Upload file**, and then either browse the files from your system or drag and drop them in the pre-defined area.

<Image
  src={mediaUploadArea}
  alt="Media upload area"
  className="h-auto w-full"
  unoptimized
/>

---

## Using folders

To create a folder, click on **Create new folder**, and enter the folder's name.

Folders are a great way to organize your files. You can nest media inside of a folder and associate a custom name to it for easier search.

<Note>
  If you are already inside of another folder, when adding a new one, it will be
  nested inside of the current active folder. This rule applies when uploading
  media files as well.
</Note>

## Modify image

If the file is of type image, you will be able to modify the aspect-ratio, zoom-in/out, flip and crop it before uploading.

You can do this by uploading an image and clicking on the <Pen /> which will open the editing mode. All available options are located at the bottom.

<Image
  src={mediaModifyImage}
  alt="Media modify image"
  className="h-auto w-full"
  unoptimized
/>

---

## Deleting media

To delete a media or a folder you can click on the <TrashBin /> that is located on each individual file/folder.

<Note>
  This will remove the media from all places where it is used, so delete media
  with caution.
