# Working with media

Media manager allows you to store your images, videos and other files with many ways to organize them [using folders](/inside-bcms/media#using-folders).

---

## Uploading media

To upload a media file, click on **Upload file**, and then either browse the files from your system or drag and drop them in the pre-defined area.

<Image
  src={imageOne}
  alt="Upload file"
  className="h-auto w-full"
  unoptimized
/>

---

## Using folders

To create a folder, click on **Create new folder**, and enter the folder's name.

<Image
  src={imageTwo}
  alt="Create new folder"
  className="h-auto w-full"
  unoptimized
/>

Folders are a great way to organize your files. You can nest media inside of a folder and associate a custom name to it for easier search.

<Note>
  If you are already inside of another folder, when adding a new one, it will be
  nested inside of the current active folder. This rule applies when uploading
  media files as well.
</Note>

## Rename files

You can rename a file by clicking on the <ThreeDots /> icon which will open the editing mode.

<Image
  src={imageThree}
  alt="Rename file"
  className="h-auto w-full"
  unoptimized
/>

---

## Deleting media

To delete a media or a folder you can click on the <TrashBin /> that is located under individual file/folder's <ThreeDots /> dropdown.

<Note>
  This will remove the media from all places where it is used, so delete media
  with caution.
</Note>

<Image
  src={imageFour}
  alt="Media upload area"
  className="h-auto w-full"
  unoptimized
/>
