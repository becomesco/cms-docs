# Working with groups

Groups in BCMS are reusable building blocks that are made of many [properties](/inside-bcms/properties). Groups can be included in any template, widget or even other groups.

<Note>
  Just like with the most of BCMS properties, groups can be used as arrays.

To edit a group, click on the group you want to edit and update properties, or click on the "Edit group" to edit the label or description.

## Adding properties to a group

To add properties to your newly created group, drag and configure properties to the group area.

## Deleting a group

Deleting a group is as easy as clicking on the **Delete group**, inside the edit group modal.

<Note>
  This will remove the group from all places where it is used, so delete groups
  with caution.
