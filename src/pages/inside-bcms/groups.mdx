# Working with groups

Groups in BCMS are reusable building blocks that are made of multiple [properties](/inside-bcms/properties). Groups can be included in any template, widget or even other groups.

<Note>
  Just like with the most of BCMS properties, groups can be used as arrays.

## Creating and editing a group

To create a group, click on "Add new group". In the next step, fill in the label, and optional description.

To edit a group, click on the group you want to edit and update properties, or click on the <Pen /> beside the label to edit the label or description.

<Image
  src={groupsMain}

## Adding properties to a group

To add properties to your newly created group, click "Add property" button, and select from the list of properties.

---

## View where is a group used

To view where is a group used, click "See where is it used". This will give you the list of all places where this group is currently used.

---

## Deleting a group

Deleting a group is as easy as clicking on the "Delete" button, entering the group's name and clicking "Confirm".

<Note>
  This will remove the group from all places where it is used, so delete groups
  with caution.
