# Nuxt.js plugin for BCMS

This is the Nuxt.js plugin documentation for the BCMS.

## Starting a project from scratch

If you are starting a Nuxt.js project from scratch, and want to connect it with BCMS, You can initialize Nuxt project by using the [BCMS CLI](/cli).
Through an interactive terminal questionary, BCMS cli will set it up for you.

To install BCMS CLI globally, run `npm install -g @becomes/cms-cli`. After that, you should be able to create a Nuxt project and connect it with BCMS by running: `bcms --website create`. Here you can read more about [BCMS CLI](/cli). If you want to add BCMS to an existing Nuxt project, that's described [here]().

## Adding BCMS to an existing Nuxt project

Developers usualy start Nuxt.js & BCMS with [BCMS CLI](/cli) projects by running `bcms --website create`, like described above. If you want to add BCMS to an existing Nuxt.js project, follow along.

First you'll need to install the BCMS Nuxt.js plugin by running `nuxt-plugin-bcms`. After that, add this code to your `nuxt.config.js` modules section:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript
modules: [
  ...
  [
    'nuxt-plugin-bcms',
    createBcmsNuxtConfig({
      cms: {
        origin: process.env.BCMS_API_ORIGIN /** your BCMS_API_ORIGIN */,
        key: {
          id:  process.env.BCMS_API_KEY /** your BCMS_API_KEY */,
          secret:  process.env.BCMS_API_SECRET /** your BCMS_API_SECRET */
        },
      },
      websiteDomain: process.env.ORIGIN || 'http://localhost:3000',
      media: {
        download: false,
      },
    }),
  ],
]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Getting data from BCMS in a Nuxt page

There are two ways how you can get data in Nuxt page.

The first is by using BCMS Client methods, available in Nuxt context with the name **$bcms**. The other way is by making API calls to the Nuxt middleware, by using **$bcms.request( ... )**. Depending on how complex your use case is, you'll chose the simpler on more complex one.

### Getting data in a Nuxt.js page using BCMS Client

If you want to get an entry from Blog template, and the entry's slug is _'how-to-connect-bcms-and-nuxtjs'_, all you have to do is:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript {{ title: 'Nuxt.js 3' }}
  const { data } = useAsyncData(async (ctx) => {
    return (await ctx?.$bcms.entry.get({
      template: 'blog',
      entry: 'how-to-connect-bcms-and-nuxtjs',
    })) as HomeEntry[];
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

For this particular use case, you will probably put this code in your `blog/_slug.vue` file, and set entry parameter to be dynamic, like this: `entry: ctx.route.params.slug`.

To learn more about all available options, read the [BCMS CLI documentation](/cli).

### Getting data using Nuxt middleware API

When using BCMS with Nuxt middleware API, you don't call BCMS API endpoints every time you need something from the CMS. Instead, Nuxt middleware caches the reponse data in RAM, prividing fast response time and more flexibility. Here's how to set it up:

Create a `bcms.routes.ts` file. Inside, let's create a simple configuration and and an endpoint which will return list of all templates.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript
import { createBcmsMostServerRoutes, createBcmsMostServerRoute } from '@becomes/cms-most';

export default createBcmsMostServerRoutes({
  '/template-list.json': createBcmsMostServerRoute({
    method: 'get',
    async handler({ bcms }) {
      await bcms.template.pull();
      const result = await bcms.template.find(async () => true);
      return result.map((temp) => {
        return {
          title: temp.label,
          slug: '/' + temp.name,
        };
      });
    },
  }),
});
````
</CodeGroup>

In the example above, we quickly created an endpoint that returns a light model of all templates from the BCMS, containing only *title* and *slug* properties of each template.

You can now call this endpoint inside of *asyncData*, as shown bellow:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript
const { data } = useAsyncData(async (ctx) => {
  const result = await ctx?.$bcms.request<Array<{ title: string; slug: string }>>({
    url: '/template-list.json',
  });
  return result;
});
````

</CodeGroup>
