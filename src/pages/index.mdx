# Welcome to BCMS documentation

BCMS is an open-source, self-hosted, Headless Content Management System.

Chances are, you are exploring different tools now, and wondering "How's BCMS any different?".
As developers, we worked with most of them, and then decided to make BCMS, with simple ideas:
- It should empower teams working on modern websites
- It must be easy to adapt to the frequent changes that teams have in their projects
- Meanwhile, it must remain beautiful
- Remain equally super-intuitive, even for non-technical people in your team
- Keep being blazingly fast even with a lot of content
- Let you integrate BCMS with other tools
- Avoid any kind of vendor-locking
