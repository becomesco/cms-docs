# BCMS Jobs

BCMS Jobs are JavaScript functions that execute at a specified time interval.

To create simple jobs that fit into one .ts file, you can follow the explanation below.
For more complex jobs, or when you want to benefit autocomplete, split it into several files, services etc.,
you can [code your jobs locally](/customization/jobs).
