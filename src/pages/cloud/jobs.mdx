# BCMS Jobs

BCMS Jobs are JavaScript functions which are executed at specified time interval.
For simple jobs (when logic can be placed in 1 file and you do not need
autocomplete) we recommend creating jobs like explained on this page, but
for complex jobs (when you need utilities, file structure, services...)
we recommend [using your favorite code editor to create them](https://github.com/becomesco/cms#getting-started).

## Add a job

Login to the [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and open an Instance to
which you would like to add a job. When on the Instance screen click on
**Jobs** card. From here, click on **Add new job** button where you
will need to provide few information:

- Job name - Can be any name that you like.
- Cron time - Interval, at which the job will be executed, in
  [Cron job format](https://crontab.guru/)
- Global scope - Is the place where you want to do your imports and declare
  utility functions.
- Handler scope - Is the code which will be executed at specified interval.

When job is added, you will need to wait a little bit for CMS to rebuild
with new configuration.
