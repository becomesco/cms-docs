# BCMS Dependencies

When you are writing your own [Functions](/cloud/functions), [Events](/cloud/events)
or [Jobs](/cloud/jobs) you might be in need of NPM packages which are not
preinstalled with the CMS (for example [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)).
Dependencies allows you to specify which additional dependencies your project
needs.

<Note>
  It is important to know that if you provide an invalid dependency it will result
  in CMS crash which will start the CMS in safe mode.

## Adding dependency

Login to the [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and open an Instance to
which you would like to add a dependency. When on the Instance screen click on
**Dependencies** card. From here, click on **Add new dependency** button and you
will be able to add package name and version. **Package name** must be a valid
NPM dependency name and **Package version** must be a valid version for
specified package.

When dependency is added, you will need to wait a little bit for CMS to rebuild
with new configuration.
