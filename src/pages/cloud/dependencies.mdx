# BCMS Dependencies

When you write your [Functions](/cloud/functions), [Events](/cloud/events)
and [Jobs](/cloud/jobs) you will probably want to install some NPM packages which are not
already installed with the CMS (for example [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)).

BCMS dependencies allow you to specify which additional NPM packages your project needs.
