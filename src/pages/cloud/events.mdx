# BCMS Events

BCMS Events are JavaScript functions which are executed by internal BCMS Events.
For simple events (when logic can be placed in 1 file and you do not need
autocomplete) we recommend creating events like explained on this page, but
for complex events (when you need utilities, file structure, services...)
we recommend [using your favorite code editor to create them](/customization/events).

## Add an event

Login to the [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and open an Instance to
which you would like to add an event. When on the Instance screen click on
**Events** card. From here, click on **Add new event** button where you
will need to provide few things:

- Event name - Can be any name that you want.
- Event scope - Is the scope for which the event will be called. This can be 1 of
[predefined BCMS event scopes](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-backend/blob/master/src/types/event/config.ts#L4)
or name of a custom event scope.
- Method - Defines which method will trigger the event.
- Global scope - Is the place where you want to do your imports and declare
utility functions.
- Handler scope - Is the code which will be executed when the event
is called. Here you have access to: `scope`, `method` and `payload` objects.
More information [here](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-backend/blob/master/src/types/event/main.ts#L9)

When event is added, you will need to wait a little bit for CMS to rebuild
with new configuration.
