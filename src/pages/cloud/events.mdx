# BCMS Events

BCMS Events are JavaScript functions that get triggered by events inside BCMS.
They allow you to run some custom code when a specific event happens.

To create simple events that fit into one .ts file, you can follow the instructions below.
For more complex events, or when you want to benefit autocomplete, split it into several files, services etc.,
you can [code your events locally](/customization/events).

## Adding an event

log in to the [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and open the instance you would like to add an event to.
On the instance page click on **Events** card, then on **Add new event** button. There you'll be able to provide some information:

- Event name - Can be any name that you want.
- Event scope - This can be one of
these [predefined BCMS event scopes](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-backend/blob/master/src/types/event/config.ts#L4) or name of a custom event scope.
- Method - Defines which method will trigger the event. Can be one of these [predefined BCMS event methods](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-backend/blob/master/src/types/event/config.ts#L21).
- Global scope - Is the place where you want to do your imports and declare utility functions.
- Handler scope - Is your code that will execute on every event call. Here you have access to: `scope`, `method` and `payload` objects.
More information [here](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-backend/blob/master/src/types/event/main.ts#L9)
