# NginX configuration

All outside connections to your CMS are going through the [Nginx](https://nginx.org).
If you are looking to add a custom domain name, you should look at [domain configuration](/cloud/domains).
If you are looking for advanced proxy configuration for your CMS, you are at the
tight place.

---

It is important to note that adding or changing Nginx configuration can brake your CMS and make it unreachable.

## Adding configuration

To add the configuration, open the [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and
navigate to an Instance to which you would like to add a configuration. When on
an Instance screen click on **Nginx config**.

<Image
  src={addConfig}
  alt="Add nginx configuration"
  className="h-auto w-full"
  unoptimized
/>

From here, click on **Add new configuration** and modal will open which will
allow you to set _Configuration name_ and [Virtual Host configuration](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/web-server/).
Name can be any name you wish but Virtual Host configuration must follow the Nginx
configuration syntax.

Example where you might want to use Nginx configuration is if you would like to
make some files available in you CMS on some domain without allowing access to
the CMS itself.

```nginx
listen 80;
listen [::]:80;
server_name demo.example.com;

location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/index.html $uri/ =404;
}
root /bcms-share/demo/;

error_page 404 /404.html;
```
