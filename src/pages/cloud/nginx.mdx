# NginX configuration

All outside connections to your CMS are going through the [Nginx](https://nginx.org).
If you are looking to add a custom domain name, you should look at [domain configuration](/cloud/domains).
If you are looking for advanced proxy configuration for your CMS, you are at the
tight place.

<Note danger>
  Please note that adding or changing Nginx configuration can break your CMS and make it unreachable.
</Note>
