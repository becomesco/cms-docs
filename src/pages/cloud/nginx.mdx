# NginX configuration

All outside connections to your CMS are going through the [Nginx](https://nginx.org).
If you are looking to add a custom domain name, you should look at [domain configuration](/cloud/domains).
If you are looking for advanced proxy configuration for your CMS, you are at the
tight place.

<Note>
  It is important to note that adding or changing Nginx configuration can brake your CMS and make it unreachable.

## Adding configuration

To add a configuration, open the [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and
navigate to an Instance screen to which you would like to add a configuration. When on
an Instance screen click on **Nginx config** card.

From here, click on **Add new configuration** and modal will open which will
allow you to set _Configuration name_ and [Virtual Host configuration](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/web-server/).
Name can be any name you wish but Virtual Host configuration must follow the Nginx
configuration syntax.
