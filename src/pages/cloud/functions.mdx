# BCMS Functions

BCMS Functions are JavaScript functions that can be executed by sending an
HTTP request to the BCMS back end API. Once function is created, it will be
available at `POST: https://{CMS_DOMAIN}/api/function/{FUNCTION_NAME}`.
For simple function (when logic can be placed in 1 file and you do not need
autocomplete) we recommend creating function like explained on this page, but
for complex functions (when you need utilities, file structure, services...)
we recommend [using your favorite code editor to create them](/customization/functions).

## Add a function

Login to the [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and open an Instance to
which you would like to add a function. When on the Instance screen click on
**Functions** card. From here, click on **Add new function** button where you
will need to provide few things:

- Function name - Is the name of the function and it can be any string. Just have
in mind that name will be *slugified*. For example, if the name is **Test function**,
it will be converted to `test-function`.
- Access to function - Can be **Public** or **Private**. Public function will be
accessible to anyone while private function will require [API Key](/inside-bcms/key-manager)
authorization.
- Global scope - Is the place where you want to do your imports and declare
utility functions.
- Handler scope - Is the code which will be called when endpoint of the function
is called. Here you have access to: `request`, `errorHandler`, `logger` and `auth` objects.
More information [here](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-backend/blob/master/src/types/function/models/main.ts#L37)

When function is added, you will need to wait a little bit for CMS to rebuild
with new configuration.
