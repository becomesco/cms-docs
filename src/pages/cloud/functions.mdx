# BCMS Functions

BCMS Functions are JavaScript functions that you can execute by sending an
HTTP request to the back end API. Once you create a function, it will be
available at <br />`POST: https://{CMS_DOMAIN}/api/function/{FUNCTION_NAME}`.

To create simple functions that fit into one .ts file, you can follow the instructions below.
For more complex functions, or when you want to benefit autocomplete, split it into several files, services etc.,
you can [code your functions locally](/customization/functions).

## Adding a function

log in to the [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and open the instance you would like to add a function to.
Click on the **Functions** card. From here, click on **Add new function** button where you can provide a few things:

- Function name - the name of the function, as string. Keep in mind
in mind that the name will be *slugified*. For example, if the name is **Test function**,
it will becomes `test-function`.
- Access to function - Can be **Public** or **Private**. Public function will be
accessible to anyone while private function will require [API Key](/inside-bcms/key-manager)
authorization.
- Global scope - The place where you want to do your imports and declare
utility functions.
- Handler scope - The code which will be called when endpoint of the function
is called. Here you have access to: `request`, `errorHandler`, `logger` and `auth` objects.
