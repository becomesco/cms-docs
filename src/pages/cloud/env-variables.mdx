# BCMS Environment variables

Environment variables provide a way to pass variables to the CMS. They are
useful when you have a [custom code](/customization) on your CMS and need access
to some shared string data. One example might be: URL to some API, secret key,
SMTP credentials...

## Add an environment variable

Login to the [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and open an Instance to
which you would like to add an environment variable. When on the Instance screen click on
**Environment variables** card. From here, click on **Add new variable** and
enter variable key (name of the variable) and its value. After that click on
**Save** button.

When 1 or more variables are added, you will need to wait a little bit for CMS to rebuild
with new configuration.
