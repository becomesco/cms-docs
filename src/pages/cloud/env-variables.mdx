# BCMS Environment variables

Environment variables provide a way to pass variables to the CMS. They are
useful when you have a [custom code](/customization) on your CMS and need access
to some shared string data. One example might be: URL to some API, secret key,
SMTP credentials...

which you would like to add an environment variable. When on the instance page click on
