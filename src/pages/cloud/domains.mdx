# Adding custom domain to BCMS

When you create a BCMS Instance, you will also get a domain to access your CMS. It's in `{ORG_NAME}-{INSTANCE_NAME}.yourbcms.com` format.
To make the CMS accessible via the custom domain name (for example, `cms.your-company.com`)
you will need to add domain and configure it on the Cloud.

---

## Adding a domain name

In your [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) account, and open the instance to
which you would like to add a domain name.

On the instance page click on **Domains** card, then on **Add new domain** button, where you will need to provide a few details:

- Domain name - domain or sub-domain name which you would like to use.
- SSL Certificate - **Optional** provided by your domain name provider. If you
  are using [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a DNS you can use
  _Origin server certificate_.
- SSL Private Key - **Required if you add SSL Certificate**, it's also
  provided by your domain name provider and paired with SSL Certificate.
- Proxy config - [Nginx configuration](/cloud/nginx) for the specified domain name.
