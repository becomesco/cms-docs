# Adding custom domain to BCMS

When you create a BCMS Instance, you will also get a domain name from which
you can access the CMS (it will be in format `{ORG_NAME}-{INSTANCE_NAME}.yourbcms.com`).
To make the CMS accessible from the custom domain name (e.g. `cms.my-company.com`)
you will need to add it and configure it on the Cloud.

## Add a domain name

Login to the [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and open an Instance to
which you would like to add a domain name. When on the Instance screen click on
**Domains** card. From here, click on **Add new domain** button where you
will need to provide few information:

- Domain name - domain or sub-domain name which you would like to use.
- SSL Certificate - **Optional** provided by your domain name provider. If you
  are using [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a DNS you can use
  _Origin server certificate_.
- SSL Private Key - **Required if SSL Certificate is provided**, it is also
  provided by your domain name provider and is paired with SSL Certificate.
- Proxy config - [Nginx configuration](/cloud/nginx) for specified domain name.

When domain name is added, you will need to wait a little bit for CMS to rebuild
with new configuration.
